Data Structures & Algorithms Interview Prep

A structured repository tracking my daily progress in mastering Data Structures and Algorithms for technical interviews. This collection focuses on writing clean, optimized, and well-documented code.

##  Resources & Roadmaps
I am following industry-standard roadmaps to ensure comprehensive coverage:
NeetCode 250: Covering all core patterns.
Striver’s SDE Sheet: Targeted preparation for top product-based companies.
LeetCode: Daily challenges and top interview questions.

##  Objectives
Consistency: Solving at least one problem every single day.
Optimization: Moving beyond "Brute Force" to find the most efficient Time & Space complexities.
Pattern Recognition: Identifying underlying patterns (Sliding Window, Two Pointers, DP, etc.).
Clean Code: Writing production-quality code with proper naming conventions.

##  Repository Structure
Each solution includes:
1. The Code: Optimized solution (C++/Java/Python).
2. Explanation: A brief breakdown of the logic/intuition.
3. Complexity Analysis: Big-O notation for Time and Space.


"Consistency is the key to mastery."
